# Human-Activity-Detection-Recognition-Thesis-Project
In this project I used Mediapipe to estimate both facial and body landmarks. With that data I build custom pose classification models that allowed to decode what a person might be saying with their body language with fine grain accuracy.

Run Steps:
1. First run the main.py file to get the csv data
2. Then run the training.py file ( build custom pose classification models ) 
3. Then finally run the results.py file for get the results
